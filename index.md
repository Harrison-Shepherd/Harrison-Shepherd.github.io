## ðŸš€ Projects  

### [Sports Web-Scraper](https://github.com/Harrison-Shepherd/Champion-Data-Scraper)  
Developed a Python-based web scraper to extract 15 years of sports data from the Champion Data API, including fixtures, matches, period statistics, and scoring events. Processed JSON data with pandas and integrated it into a MySQL database using transactional batch uploads to ensure efficiency and data integrity. Designed modular scripts for targeted scrapes and CSV generation, demonstrating advanced data engineering skills such as API interaction, relational database design, and data pipeline optimization.  

### [Linear Regression Model](https://github.com/Harrison-Shepherd/Linear-Regression-Model)  
Engineered a dataset to predict monthly energy consumption using linear regression techniques. Applied rigorous data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering, addressing missing values, outliers, and typos with tools like Fuzzy Wuzzy and the Interquartile Range method. Built and compared three modelsâ€”Vanilla Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regressionâ€”evaluating performance using RMSE and RÂ² metrics. Demonstrated expertise in Python, scikit-learn, and statistical analysis.  

### [Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/Harrison-Shepherd/Convolutional-Neural-Network)  
Implemented a CNN in TensorFlow to classify images into multiple categories. Preprocessed image datasets, augmented data for improved generalization, and trained the model using techniques such as batch normalization and dropout to prevent overfitting. Achieved high accuracy on the test set through optimized learning rate scheduling and robust validation practices. Proficient in Python, TensorFlow, and data preprocessing with NumPy and pandas.  

### [Campground Booking Management System](https://github.com/Harrison-Shepherd/Database-Campground-Project)  
Built a comprehensive system to manage campground bookings, allocate campsites, generate confirmations, and produce daily summaries. Designed a web-based interface with Flask and integrated SQL Server and Cosmos DB on Microsoft Azure for efficient data storage. Key features include dynamic campsite allocation, PDF generation for booking confirmations, and automated daily summaries. Demonstrated proficiency in Python, Flask, Azure cloud services, and database management.  

### [Find a Campsite App](https://github.com/Harrison-Shepherd/Find-a-Campsite-App)  
Designed a Kivy-based GUI application for campsite booking management. Integrated secure account creation, encrypted login, password recovery, and a help screen. Used Redis as the backend for secure data storage with bcrypt encryption. Key functionalities include intuitive navigation, real-time validation, and comprehensive error handling, showcasing expertise in Python, Kivy, and Redis.
